# pushpop

*mental stack manager*


You're working on one thing... another problem arises... or an interruption occurs... you need to push the new thing on top of your mental stack.

What do you do?

pushpop is a mental stack manager.

It lets you see the top of your mental stack.

## Pop

When you've completed a task, click `pop`. (it makes a nice popping sound) and that task is gone.

The next item rises back to the top of the stack.

## Push

But wait... you are interrupted in your quest to complete the item on top of the stack.

What do you do? You enter the new item into the textbox, and `push` it. Now that item is on top.

## Peek

There's one more feature... `peek...`

Peek let's you inspect the entire mental stack. You can drag items around to reorder them. You can search for items (and can move the item you find to the top of the stack). 

Finished peeking? Click `peeking...` to hide the stack away.

## History

While peeking, you can also view previously completed items, if you click `history...`.
